<h1>What are the 7 wonders of the world?</h1> 
<p>The 7 wonders Of the World was a concept created by ancient greeks(hellenics) between 8th century BCE and 6th century AD, due to this most origonal wonders were located in the meddertatian and present day middle east.<br>
In 2000, a campaign was initiated to create a new list of 7 wonders as the origonal list was compiled in 200BCE, as a result a new set of wonders were created they are the following:</p>

<h2>Great Wall Of China</h2>
<img src="gwoc.jpg" style="width:1000px;height:600px;"><br>
<p>Great might be an understatement. One of the world’s largest building-construction projects, the Great Wall of China is widely thought to be about 5,500 miles (8,850 km) long.Although it was built to prevent invasions and raids,<br> the wall largely failed to provide actual security. Instead, scholars have noted that it served more as “political propaganda.”</p>

<h2>Chichen Itza</h2>
<img src="ci.jpg" style="width:1000px;height:600px;"><br>
<p>Chichén Itzá is a Mayan city on the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico, which flourished in the 9th and 10th centuries CE. Under the Mayan tribe Itzá—who were strongly influenced by the Toltecs—a number of important monuments and temples<br> were built.A testament to the Mayans’ astronomical abilities, the structure features a total of 365 steps, the number of days in the solar year. During the spring and autumnal equinoxes, the setting sun casts shadows on the pyramid that give<br> the appearance of a serpent slithering down the north stairway; at the base is a stone snake head. </p>

<h2>Petra</h2>
<img src="Petra.jpg" style="width:1000px;height:600px;"><br>
<p>The ancient city of Petra, Jordan, is located in a remote valley, nestled among sandstone mountains and cliffs.At its height, Petra reportedly had a population of 30,000. The city began to decline, however, as trade routes shifted.<br> A major earthquake in 363 CE caused more difficulty, and after another tremor hit in 551, Petra was gradually abandoned</p>

<h2>Machu Picchu</h2>
<img src="mp.jpg" style="width:1000px;height:600px;"><br>
<p>This Incan site near Cuzco, Peru, was “discovered” in 1911 by Hiram Bingham, who believed it was Vilcabamba, a secret Incan stronghold used during the 16th-century rebellion against Spanish rule. Although that<br> claim was later disproved, the purpose of Machu Picchu has confounded scholars. Bingham believed it was home to the “Virgins of the Sun,” women who lived in convents under a vow of chastity. Others think that it was likely a<br> pilgrimage site, while some believe it was a royal retreat.</p>

<h2>Christ the Redeemer</h2>
<img src="ctr.jpg" style="width:1000px;height:600px;"><br>
<p>Christ the Redeemer, a colossal statue of Jesus, stands atop Mount Corcovado in Rio de Janeiro. Its origins date to just after World War I, when some Brazilians feared a “tide of godlessness.”The resulting monument stands 98 feet (30 meters)<br> tall—not including its base, which is about 26 feet (8 meters) high—and its outstretched arms span 92 feet (28 meters).</p>

<h2>Roman Colosseum</h2>
<img src="col.jpg" style="width:1000px;height:600px;"><br>
<p>The Colosseum in Rome was built in the first century by order of the Emperor Vespasian. A feat of engineering, the amphitheater measures 620 by 513 feet (189 by 156 meters) and features a complex system of vaults. It was capable of holding<br> 50,000 spectators, who watched a variety of events. Perhaps most notable were gladiator fights, though men battling animals was also common.</p>

<h2>Taj Mahal</h2>
<img src="tm.jpg" style="width:1000px;height:600px;"><br>
<p>This mausoleum complex in Agra, India, is regarded as one of the world’s most iconic monuments and is perhaps the finest example of Mughal architecture. It was built by Emperor Shah Jahān (reigned 1628–58) to honor his wife<br> Mumtāz Maḥal (“Chosen One of the Palace”), who died in 1631 giving birth to their 14th child. It took about 22 years and 20,000 workers to construct the complex</p>
